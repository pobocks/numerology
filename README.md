This is a very small program with a very simple purpose: calculating name numbers.  My wife got bored and decided to do my numerology, and I wrote this while she was working it out.

It might be reasonable to use this problem as the model for an interview question or basic programming test.  Or you can use it to find out your numerology numbers.  All other uses are fully permitted, but will be regarded with raised eyebrow by the author.
